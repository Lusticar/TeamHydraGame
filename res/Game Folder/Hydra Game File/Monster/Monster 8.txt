Monster Description:
This armored unit features an angular frame, and is treated in a carbon-black R.A.M. coating in order to reduce its radar cross section. Its composite plating has also incorporated reactive armor to go along with its suite of active protec-tion systems and anti-infantry short range missiles. The 125mm main gun is assisted by a state of the art ballistics fire control computer, so it is advisable that the tank be disabled in some way prior to engagement.
