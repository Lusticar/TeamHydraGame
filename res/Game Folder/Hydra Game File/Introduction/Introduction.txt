EMPYREAN, a multinational conglomerate, has recently had a major incident in one of their remote research facilities. A new iteration of their Incumbent-Class A.I. systems used for information warfare has gone against its protocols, and has done major damage within the sector it resides in. Security protocols and countermeasures have been enacted in order to quarantine the subject, and to prevent its influence on sector systems. However, many machines/networks are still unresponsive, and are considered to be highly dangerous given their rogue nature. The company doesn’t want to risk any unnecessary resources or agents to get this issue resolved so they're sending you, one of their best arbitrators, to fix this mess. You’ll be dropped off at the location, and rendezvous with the superintendent construct inside the facility. It’s been keeping the A.I. contained, and it’ll provide you with any additional information you may want to know.
